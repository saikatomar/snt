## Task 3

### Compare the average salary of female verses male employees in the entire company until year 2002, and add a filter allowing you to see that per each department.

Solution: In this solution we would need four columns; gender, department name, average salary, and year. Furthermore, because the question asked to differenciate data by gender, dept and year, the code will be grouped by gender, dept number and year.
