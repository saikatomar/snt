## Task 2:

### Compare the number of male managers to the number of female managers from different departments for each year, starting from 1990.

<i> Solution: </i>

The way to represent the visualization of this problem is to visually compare the proportional relationship between the quantities examined. The reason for using active column is to differentiate an employee being active in a given year.
